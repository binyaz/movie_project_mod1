# Purpose of the project
In this project, my team and I developed a few graphs to help a new movie studio produce the most profitable movies. We used data sets that were given to us, to produce graphs that offer the most informative information. After the graphs were uploaded, we combined, cleaned, and organized the data into one useful graph where we were able to draw many conclusions. 

# First question: Which movie genre profits the most money?
To answer this question we took the original data set, deleted unnecessary rows and columns, and plotted our data using a bar graph with genres on the x-axis and profits on the y-axis. We also removed outliers by setting a minimum of ten movies per genre. The data showed that the Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi genre profited the most money at over $400,000,000, while the second most popular genre was Action, Adventure, Animation with just over $300,000,000.

# Second question: Which actor/actress is the most profitable to have in your movie?
Our approach to answering this question is very similar to our approach to answering the first question where we cleaned the data in a similar way and eliminated outliers with a minimum of ten movies per actor/actress. We plotted this data using a bar graph with the most profitable actors/actresses on the x-axis and the average profit of their movies on the y-axis. We learned that movies that have Robert Downey Jr in the case profit over $700,000,000 on average while the second most profitable actor/actress is Chris Evans with around $450,000,000.

# Third question: What is the best month to release a movie in?
Our approach to this question was very similar to the first two where we used a bar graph and plotted the months on the x-axis and the profit on the y-axis. We concluded that if on average one will profit $90,000,000 more if they release the movie in June as opposed to September.

# Other interesting points that donâ€™t have an effect on profit:
We made two scatter plots with a linear regression line that showed that the run time of the movie and the IMDB rating have very little effect on the profit of the movie.

# Conclusion:
We concluded that if a new movie studio were choosing what kind of movie they should release and in what month, they should release an Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, starring Robert Downey Jr. in the month of June.
